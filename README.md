# MathSkillZ
Just some links to help you develop some of the quantitative skills you might need in the lab.

Given that the work you are doing in the lab integrates quantitative genetics, statistics, evolutionary biology, geometric morphometrics, developmental biology and genomics, it should come as no surprise that some fundamental math skills are necessary. It is ok if you come to the lab without specific understanding of some of these mathematical methods (technically and or conceptually), but you will find your life much easier if you learn them. So Here is a place for some links to help you.

In each case I start with really basic links, so you may be able to skip forward quickly. If you do, and find yourself confused, just go back to an earlier set of tutorials!

What sorts of mathematical skills are so important?
- Geometry (morphometrics, quantitative genetics, evolutionary biology and statistics).
- Linear algebra (morphometrics, quantitative genetics, evolutionary biology and statistics).
- Basic Probability theory
- Basic differential calculus, integral calculus and simple ordinary differential equations.


## online
Obviously [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a great place to start, whether to review or learn. I use it all the time (and I find the activities fun). Get a (free) account!

### Geometry
- [Basic Geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo). Angles,The coordinate plane and transformations are key!
- [Geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry).  Euclidian Geometry, Tools, angles, transformations, congruence, similarity, right triangles, analytic geometry
 
### Algebra (pre-University review)
- [Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra). Pretty much all of it (review of high school math).
    -[Algebra Basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics)
    - [Fundamental algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)
    - [Slightly more advanced algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2)

### [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [Vectors and Spaces](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces). Vectors, linear combinations, linear dependence, subspaces, vector dot and cross products.
- [Matrix Transformations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix_transformations)
- [Alternative Coordinate systems](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate_bases). In particular orthogonal projections, change of basis and "eigen-everything".

### [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability)
- Everything is probably useful.
- Also check out my own stuff on this [here](https://github.com/DworkinLab/CSE845_R_tutorials). Some have screencasts on youotube.
